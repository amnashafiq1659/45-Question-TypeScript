// Question 10:
// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// 1st Program:
// This program adds two number and prints the result:

// define two numbers 
let num1:number = 10;
let num2:number = 20;

// add two numbers
let result:number = num1 + num2;

//print result
console.log(result);

//2nd Program:

// store my name in variable
let myName:string = "Amna Shafiq";

// store my age in variable
let myAge:number = 15;

// print my name and age using type literals
console.log(`My name is ${myName} and I am ${myAge} years old.`)
